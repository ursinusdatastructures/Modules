  instructions: "Fill in the code that uses union find to create a spanning tree from edges that are traversed in some specified order.  The key step is to skip edges that would create a cycle if added.  You can check to see if an edge will create a cycle by using a disjoint set data structure and seeing if the nodes it would connect already belong to the same component."
  goals:
    - Use union and find operations of a disjoint set data structure
    - Create spanning trees
