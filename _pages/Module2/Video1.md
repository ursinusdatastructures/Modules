<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href = "https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>, or "numerical python," is a library that's used to store numerical lists called <b>numpy arrays</b>, and it has a lot of useful methods for manipulating arrays</li>
<li>Numpy's <a href = "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html">arange</a> method can be used to make an array of sequential numbers</li>
<li>Numpy's <a href = "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randn.html">random.randn</a> method can be used to generate an array of random numbers sampled from a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian distribution</a> with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.</li>
<li>Numpy's <a href = "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html">zeros</a> method can be used to initialize an array with zeros.</li>
<li><a href = "https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> is a python plotting library that works in synergy with numpy, and it allows us to plot numpy arrays.  For example, you can plot a stem plot with <code>plt.stem</code>, a regular line plot with <code>plt.plot</code>, and a histogram with <code>plt.hist</code>.</li>
