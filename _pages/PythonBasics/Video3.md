<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Methods are defined as <code> def method_name(param1, param2, ...):</code>.  You do not need to specify the types of arguments or the return value, so the code is very succinct and general purpose!</li>
<li>The entire body of a method is tabbed over one.  Getting the tabbing correct is very important!  But good IDEs will guide you with this</li>
<li>Method documentation is often provided as docstrings enclosed by <code>"""</code> detailing the expected types and purposes of all parameters, as well as the return type and purpose</li>
<li>Just as Java and C++ have <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>else if</code> statements, python has <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>elif</code>.  Just like methods, they are followed by a <code>:</code>, and their body is tabbed over by one</code></li>
<li>Logical operators can be used to make compound boolean statements as conditions for if statements, just as with Java and C++.  Components of them include
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> for equality</li>
<li><code>!=</code> for not equals</li>
<li><code><</code> and <code>></code> for less than or greater than, respectively</li>
<li><code><=</code> and <code>>=</code> for less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively</li>
<li><code>and</code> for logical AND (both must be true)</li>
<li><code>or</code> for logical OR (at least one must be true)</li>
<li><code>not</code> for logical NOT (negates what's in the statement)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
