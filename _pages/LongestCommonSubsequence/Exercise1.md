  instructions: "<p>Complete memoization in the recursive LCS code.  If you're not doing memoization properly and have to repeat problems, the recursion will take a very long time for the third example in the test code block, and <b>your browser will lock up</b>.</p>"
  goals:
    - Use memoization to speed up recursive evaluations with overlapping subproblems
